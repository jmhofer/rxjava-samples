rxjava-samples
==============

This repo contains a few simple samples for demonstrating the awesomeness that is **[RxJava](https://github.com/Netflix/RxJava)** using [Scala](http://scala-lang.org).

It also contains the [slides of my talk about RxJava](https://github.com/jmhofer/rxjava-samples/blob/master/Unter_Beobachtung.pdf) at Herbstcampus 2013 (in German, though). 
I used the code of this repo for the live coding part of the talk.
